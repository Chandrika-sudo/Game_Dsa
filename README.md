## 💝 About

This project was created as a learning tool for my sister who is beginning her programming journey. It makes DSA concepts

approachable through visual, interactive challenges with instant feedback.


## ✨ Key Features


- 📚 **5 Progressive Levels** - Gradually increasing difficulty

- 🎨 **Visual Animations** - Watch your code execute step-by-step

- 💡 **Smart Hints** - Get help when you need it

- ✅ **Instant Feedback** - Know immediately if your solution works

- 📊 **Score Tracking** - Monitor your progress

- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Works on all devices



## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally

1. Clone this repository

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-coding-game.git

   cd dsa-coding-game
   

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

   ```bash
   # On macOS
   open index.html
   
   # On Linux
   xdg-open index.html
   
   # On Windows
   start index.html
   ```

3. Start coding! 🎉

**No build process or dependencies required** - just open and play!

## 🎓 Learning Path


| 1 | Array Boundaries | Understanding array indexing and avoiding out-of-bounds errors |

| 2 | Finding Maximum | Array traversal and tracking values |

| 3 | Array Reversal | In-place array manipulation with proper loop conditions |

| 4 | Binary Search | Debugging search algorithms and preventing infinite loops |

| 5 | Bubble Sort | Implementing comparison and swap logic |



## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Read** the challenge description

2. **Edit** the code in the left panel

3. **Run** your solution

4. **Watch** the visual animation

5. **Learn** from feedback messages

6. **Proceed** to the next level when successful

💡 **Stuck?** Click the hint button for guidance!



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Structure

- **CSS3** - Styling & animations

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - Game logic

No frameworks, no dependencies - just pure web fundamentals!
